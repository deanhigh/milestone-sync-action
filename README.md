# Multirepo tools

A series of tools to aid in managing process around multirepo projects.

I have found that personally I prefer having multiple repositories but much of the tooling out there doesn't play well in a multirepo setting. I've created this small set of tools to help mitigate some shortcomings. It is likely that in the future these tools will become redundant as platforms continue to evolve, so the tools will remain small and simple (hopefully.)
