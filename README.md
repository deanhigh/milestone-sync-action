# Multirepo tools

A series of tools to aid in managing process around multirepo projects.

Many projects end up having multiple repositories but much of the tooling out there doesn't play well in a multi-repo setting. 

It is likely that in the future these tools will become redundant as platforms continue to evolve, so the tools will remain small and simple.
